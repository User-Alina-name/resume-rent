      <h2>About us</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp I arrived with my daughter Yasmin in Zurich in March 2022 from
        Ukraine. We were lucky to meet wonderful host family Larisa and Sven,
        they sheltered us and helped with integration in new life. 2 weeks ago
        our family became complete again - my husband Evgen arrived! This joyful
        event also means that we can no longer be with a couple who have become
        friends for us, since there is not enough space for all of us and we
        need our own apartment.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp Evgeny has a higher legal education, he also has experience as a
        chef in a restaurant. I found myself in the field of IT technologies.
        And despite the letter of guarantee from the AOZ about the monthly rent,
        I am sure that soon we will find a job and become solvent members of
        society ourselves! We are looking an apartment for long lines, but we
        are ready to consider all variants.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp We quiet, calm and clean family, not have pets, without bad habits
        and will be happy to find a cozy apartment for start safe life!
