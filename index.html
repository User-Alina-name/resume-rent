      <h2>About us</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp I arrived with my daughter Yasmin in Zurich in March 2022 from
        Ukraine. We were lucky to meet wonderful host family Larissa and Sven,
        they sheltered us and helped with integration in new life. At the end of
        Jule 2022 our family became complete again - my husband arrived!
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp Yevhen works as a cook in the Münsterhof restaurant in the center
        of Zürich. I graduated in web development and am actively looking for a
        job. our daughter is in the first grade of school.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp For the past 5 months we have been living in a separate apartment
        that we found ourselves and rented with the help of ABC and Yevhen's
        employment.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp And despite the letter of guarantee from the AOZ about the monthly
        rent, I am sure that soon we will find a job and become solvent members
        of society ourselves! We are looking for an apartment for any time, and
        we are ready to consider all variants.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp We quiet, calm and clean family, we have no pets, no bad habits
        and we would be so happy to find a cozy apartment!
